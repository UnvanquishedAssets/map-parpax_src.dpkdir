This map has been made with free open source software only:

    Archlinux  (https://www.archlinux.org/)
    Audacity   (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)
    GIMP       (http://www.gimp.org/)
    NetRadiant (http://icculus.org/netradiant/)
    Q3Map2     (http://shaderlab.com/q3map2/)
    VIM        (http://www.vim.org/)

The release quality compile for Tremulous is done with the following settings:

    [q3map2] -meta -custinfoparms -samplesize 8 [MapFile]
    [q3map2] -vis -saveprt [MapFile]
    [q3map2] -light -fast -shade -dirty -patchshadows -samples 3 -bouncegrid -bounce 16 -cpma [MapFile]

             The author also grants the following modifications:
             - You may edit any shaders (.shader file) as you see fit.
             - You may change the color of any "texturename.blend.tga/.jpg" or
               hue to fit the style of your map.

             In an email from evillair to Tremulous developer Timbo he said that
             he would release his texture sets under the CC-BY-SA-2.5 license
             exclusively for the Tremulous project. Even though I don't know if
             this is even possible it should probably mean that the textures may
             be altered and used commercially as long as they are distributed as
             a part of the tremulous project. I didn't edit any of his textures
             though.
