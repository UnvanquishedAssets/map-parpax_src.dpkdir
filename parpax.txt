             The author also grants the following modifications:
             - You may edit any shaders (.shader file) as you see fit.
             - You may change the color of any "texturename.blend.tga/.jpg" or
               hue to fit the style of your map.

             In an email from evillair to Tremulous developer Timbo he said that
             he would release his texture sets under the CC-BY-SA-2.5 license
             exclusively for the Tremulous project. Even though I don't know if
             this is even possible it should probably mean that the textures may
             be altered and used commercially as long as they are distributed as
             a part of the tremulous project. I didn't edit any of his textures
             though.
