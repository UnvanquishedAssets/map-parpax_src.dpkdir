             The author also grants the following modifications:
             - You may edit any shaders (.shader file) as you see fit.
             - You may change the color of any "texturename.blend.tga/.jpg" or
               hue to fit the style of your map.

             In an email from evillair to Tremulous developer Timbo he said that
             he would release his texture sets under the CC-BY-SA-2.5 license
             exclusively for the Tremulous project. Even though I don't know if
             this is even possible it should probably mean that the textures may
             be altered and used commercially as long as they are distributed as
             a part of the tremulous project.

  +-----------+
-=| CHANGELOG |=-
  +-----------+

16.08.2012 / Beta 1
    - First release

17.08.2012 / Beta 2
    - sounds/parpax/crane.wav has been added to COPYING section.
    - The emergency exit has been removed, the room behind the elevator shaft
      stays and has a normal door now.
    - One of the ladders in the elevator shaft and the hole towards upper
      storage has been removed.
    - The ventilation shafts don't reach the human base anymore.
    - Spectator teleporters have been added for easier navigation (thanks to
      Odal).
    - The lower regions of the stairs have been made brighter (thanks to Xedoh).
    - A box has been moved in long hall so humans have more space to move there.
    - The cage at the highest platform of the stairs has been removed.
    - Human default has a few crates at the side entrance now (last three:
      thanks to Nightmare).

31.08.2012 / Beta 3
    - The human default base has been replaced with a completely new room.
    - Advanced marauders (and crouching humans) are now able to enter long hall
      via pipe shaft in order to defeat campy human bases there (thanks to
      Ingar).
    - Added "steps" in elevator shaft so goons can exit it (forgot hwo proposed
      this, sorry!).
    - Some textures have been replaced with the goal to have an independent .pk3
      file eventually.
    - A bug has been fixed which denied building in some regions in elevator
      room.
    - A bug has been fixed that lead to humans surfing at the top of the
      elevator car (thanks to /dev/humancontroller).
    - A region where the void was visible was fixed (/dev/humancontroller).
    - Leftover map regions (from Beta 1) have been removed.
    - Lighting in short hall and long hall has been changed from entity based to
      shader based, lower storage (former name: front storage) will follow.
    - Lighting at the bottom of the elevator car has been improved
      (/dev/humancontroller).
    - The directory containing sounds is now named "sound" instead of "sounds"
      to comply with the standard layout (/dev/humancontroller).
    - The baked in turret model has been added to COPYING section.
    - Removed the background sound as it was registered as the level's music
      which lead to annoying noises for some players. Background sounds might
      come back later on a per-room basis.
    - Some known lighting bugs (elevator) have NOT yet been fixed, these will go
      in a later release.
