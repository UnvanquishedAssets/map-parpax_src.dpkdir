  +-----------+
-=| CHANGELOG |=-
  +-----------+

16.08.2012 / Beta 1
    - First release

17.08.2012 / Beta 2
    - sounds/parpax/crane.wav has been added to COPYING section.
    - The emergency exit has been removed, the room behind the elevator shaft
      stays and has a normal door now.
    - One of the ladders in the elevator shaft and the hole towards upper
      storage has been removed.
    - The ventilation shafts don't reach the human base anymore.
    - Spectator teleporters have been added for easier navigation (thanks to
      Odal).
    - The lower regions of the stairs have been made brighter (thanks to Xedoh).
    - A box has been moved in long hall so humans have more space to move there.
    - The cage at the highest platform of the stairs has been removed.
    - Human default has a few crates at the side entrance now (last three:
      thanks to Nightmare).

31.08.2012 / Beta 3
    - The human default base has been replaced with a completely new room.
    - Advanced marauders (and crouching humans) are now able to enter long hall
      via pipe shaft in order to defeat campy human bases there (thanks to
      Ingar).
    - Added "steps" in elevator shaft so goons can exit it (forgot who proposed
      this, sorry!).
    - Some textures have been replaced with the goal to have an independent .pk3
      file eventually.
    - A bug has been fixed which denied building in some regions in elevator
      room.
    - A bug has been fixed that lead to humans surfing at the top of the
      elevator car (thanks to /dev/humancontroller).
    - A region where the void was visible was fixed (/dev/humancontroller).
    - Leftover map regions (from Beta 1) have been removed.
    - Lighting in short hall and long hall has been changed from entity based to
      shader based, lower storage (former name: front storage) will follow.
    - Lighting at the bottom of the elevator car has been improved
      (/dev/humancontroller).
    - The directory containing sounds is now named "sound" instead of "sounds"
      to comply with the standard layout (/dev/humancontroller).
    - The baked in turret model has been added to COPYING section.
    - Removed the background sound as it was registered as the level's music
      which lead to annoying noises for some players. Background sounds might
      come back later on a per-room basis.
    - Some known lighting bugs (elevator) have NOT yet been fixed, these will go
      in a later release.

26.11.2012 / Beta 4
    - New areas: "O-stairs", "tank room", "hangar". They form a third connection
      between the lower and the upper floor (thanks to Menace and `Ishq).
    - The area "stairs entry" has been replaced with new areas ("missing tank
      room", "windowless room").
    - "upper sorage" now connects to the new "tank room" instead of "unnamed
      hall". The latter has been removed.
    - "ventilation room" now connects to the stairs (new name: "D-stairs").
    - The elevator car and shaft have been modified. The hole in the ceiling of
      the car has been centered and the car is now open at the back. The car
      moves a lot faster.
    - The girders in lower storage have been removed and the room isn't as tall
      anymore. The door towards "lower fork" has been removed, the latter has
      been renamed to "unnamed room" since it doesn't fork anymore.
    - The huge shutter doors between power distributor and lower storage open
      significantly faster.
    - I've added an alternative layout named "aggressive" where aliens start in
      upper storage and humans in lower storage. If it works out it might become
      the default layout.
    - More textures have been replaced and included in the pk3 file.
    - Lights have been scaled up by 10%.
    - Probably a lot of bugfixes and minor improvments that I forgot about.

01.03.2013 / Delta 1
    - Most textures have been replaced with modern textures that include normal
      and specular maps
    - Alternative layout has been removed
    - Lower and upper storage are connected by a hole in the floor (thanks to
      Meisseli)
    - Human default has been weakened in several ways, including another
      entrance towards D-stairs (thanks to clans DDOS and pk for their scrim)
    - Lower storage and O-stairs have been connected with a short path
    - The girders at the upper ends of the ventilation shafts now allow tyrants
      to attack
